 * The Compiler accepts a file, compile it, and emit signal when finished.
 * It should be used only once in a life time, so if you want to compile multiple files,
 * please use multiple Compilers.
 * The compilation process will be automatically killed when the Compiler is destructed,
 * so it's convenient to use one Compiler for one compilation.
 * When using it to "compile" Python, it will emit compilationFinished("") immediately.
